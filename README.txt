This Java program has been written to convert reports generated on the PW machine in C4 in B2, Westport from csv to pdf. To assist 
this action I have used libraries provided by Itext PDF, 
see https://itextpdf.com/
These libraries are provided free to use in accordance with license: 
AGPLv3 Version 3, 19 November 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 

applicable entries in the license conditions are:
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.

In other words,
As I have not modified any of the provided classes or Jar's provided by ItextPDF, which are referred to as "The Program".
I can use them here with unlimited permission. However if "The Program" was to be copied it must contain a copyright notice so
that the new user of the copied program is aware of the conditions of licensing. Which I have attached below:

If not, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

A full copy of this license will be provided in the application folders saved as AGPLv3 - GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE _ iText PDF.pdf

As a pre-caution I am also making this program open source. 

Note that the java.java class has been written from scratch and only calls the unmodified itextPDF libraries. 
This program was written in December 2024. If you have an queries/issues or require additional programs you can reach out to me at:
